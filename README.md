### enrolment on course completed

* Quick summary : Course completed enrolment handles the enrolment of users upon completion of another course.
* With this plugin it is possible to create a chain of courses.  The moment a student completes a course, he/she
  is automatically enrolled in one or more courses. But it can also be used to give a user another role when he/she
  completes the course.
* Administrators can also enrol users who completed past courses.
* When a user is part of a group in the first course, the user will also be part of the group with the same name in the second course.

* Maturity: Stable
